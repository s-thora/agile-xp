<h2>Objective</h2><p>Add a new feature to the legacy code: the board would be of aby size, defined in a configurations file.</p><p>Use <em>size</em> variable to represent the size value instead of magic constants in legacy program.&nbsp;As a result, this repeatedly used variable gets a name, which describes its meaning, and it becomes easier to read, maintain and change the code.</p><p>Configuration files would have a different structure, the first row would contain value of the board size.</p><p>Keep the original core structure of the code. You should write own tests so the program would maintain functional and new features would be implemented correctly. The program should pass all your and hidden tests.</p><h3><strong>User stories</strong></h3><ul><li>The board&nbsp;should&nbsp;be of size, defined by a configurations file</li><li>Use <em>size </em>variable to represent the board size</li><li>Board enumeration should be used on printed out playground</li></ul>
