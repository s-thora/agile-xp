<h2>Objective</h2><blockquote>Mixing levels of abstraction within a function is always confusing. Readers may not be able to tell whether a particular expression is an essential concept or a detail. Worse, like broken windows, once details are mixed with essential concepts, more and more details tend to accrete within the function.&nbsp;<br><em>(Robert C. Martin.&nbsp;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship)</em></blockquote><p>Functions setOnTurn and move do not hold the same abstraction level.</p><p>Make the current code way more readable and maintainable with extracting the functions, which hold lower abstraction levels, should be extracted.</p><p>Keep the original core structure of the code. You should write own tests so the program would maintain functional and new features would be implemented correctly. The program should pass all your and hidden tests.</p><p><br><p>Another not less important feature of clean code is that it contains no duplications.</p><blockquote>Duplication is the primary enemy of a well-designed system. It represents additional work, additional risk, and additional unnecessary complexity. Duplication manifests itself in many forms. Lines of code that look exactly alike are, of course, duplication. Lines of code that are similar can often be massaged to look even more alike so that they can be more easily refactored.&nbsp;<br><em>(Robert C. Martin.&nbsp;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship)</em></blockquote><p>Make the code way more readable and maintainable with extracting the duplicate code into functions.</p><h3><strong>User stories</strong></h3><ul><li>Extract functions&nbsp;<em>isOnTurnInputCorrect</em>, from function&nbsp;<em>setOnTurn</em></li><li>Extract functions&nbsp;<em>isEmpty</em>,&nbsp;<em>isGameOver&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>swapPlayerOnTurn&nbsp;</em>from function&nbsp;<em>move</em>.</li><li>Extract function&nbsp;<em>isTileInputCorrect&nbsp;</em>from functions&nbsp;<em>setTile&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>execute</em></li><li>Extract function&nbsp;<em>isWithinPlayground&nbsp;</em>from functions&nbsp;<em>move&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>getTilesToFlip.</em></li></ul>
