<h2>Objective</h2><blockquote><em>Now that enums have been added to the language (Java 5), use them! Don’t keep using the old trick of public static final ints. The meaning of ints can get lost. The meaning of enums cannot, because they belong to an enumeration that is named. What’s more, study the syntax for enums carefully. They can have methods and fields. This makes them very powerful tools that allow much more expression and flexibility than ints.&nbsp;<br>(Robert C. Martin.&nbsp;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship)</em></blockquote><p>Use&nbsp;Player&nbsp;enum&nbsp;to represent the players' values:</p><ul><li>Player.W&nbsp;for 'W' instead of 0;</li><li>Player.B&nbsp;for 'B' instead of 1;</li><li>Player.NONE&nbsp;for no player instead of -1.</li></ul><p>Use new enum for initialing the game and to print out the current state.</p><p>Keep the original core structure of the code. You should write own tests so the program would maintain functional and new features would be implemented correctly. The program should pass all your and hidden tests.</p><h3><strong>User stories</strong></h3><ul><li>Use&nbsp;Player&nbsp;enum&nbsp;to represent the players' values.</li></ul>
