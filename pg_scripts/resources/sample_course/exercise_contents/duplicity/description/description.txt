<h2>Objective</h2><blockquote><em>Duplication is the primary enemy of a well-designed system. It represents additional work, additional risk, and additional unnecessary complexity. Duplication manifests itself in many forms. Lines of code that look exactly alike are, of course, duplication. Lines of code that are similar can often be massaged to look even more alike so that they can be more easily refactored.&nbsp;<br>(Robert C. Martin.&nbsp;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship)</em></blockquote><p>Make the code way more readable and maintainable with extracting the duplicate code into functions.</p><p>Keep the original core structure of the code. You should write own tests so the program would maintain functional and new features would be implemented correctly. The program should pass all your and hidden tests.</p><h3><strong>User stories</strong></h3><ul><li>Extract function&nbsp;<em>isPieceInputCorrect&nbsp;</em>from functions&nbsp;<em>setPiece&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>execute</em></li><li>Extract function&nbsp;<em>isWithinPlayground&nbsp;</em>from functions&nbsp;<em>move&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>getPiecesToFlip.</em></li></ul>
