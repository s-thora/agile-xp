Martin.&nbsp;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship)</em></blockquote><p>Most of the large code was refactored in previous steps because of extracting the function from large ones. But there are more ways to reduce function size without lost of readability.</p><p>Make the code functions a way more readable with changing the structure of variable <em>left</em>.</p><p>Keep the original core structure of the code. You should write own tests so the program would maintain functional and new features would be implemented correctly. The program should pass all your and hidden tests.</p><p></p><h3><strong>User stories</strong></h3><ul><li>Use map <em>left </em>to store the values of variables <em>leftB </em>and <em>leftW</em>.</li></ul>
